# Andres Castro for the Working Class: Open Source Campaign

Welcome to the official GitHub Organization of **[CastroForGeorgia's campaign](https://andrescastro.us)**—an open-source effort dedicated to championing the rights, dignity, and prosperity of working families and marginalized communities. This organization houses our campaign’s digital tools, policy ideas, and collaborative projects aimed at building an inclusive and equitable future for all.

## Our Vision

We believe that every individual deserves access to fair wages, affordable healthcare, safe housing, and quality education. By centering the working class—who form the backbone of our society—we aim to craft legislation and create tools that uplift communities, address systemic inequalities, and empower all people to thrive.

## Why Open Source?

**Transparency and Accountability**  
Our campaign embraces open-source principles to maintain transparency, invite public oversight, and foster a spirit of collaboration. By making our work freely accessible, we ensure that stakeholders from all walks of life—especially those most impacted by policy decisions—have a direct voice in shaping our platform.

**Community-Driven Innovation**  
We encourage developers, researchers, and advocates to contribute their perspectives, expertise, and creativity. Leveraging the open-source model ensures the best ideas surface and get refined through community input, reflecting the real needs and aspirations of the working class and marginalized communities.

**Empowerment Through Collaboration**  
When people unite around shared values, transformation becomes possible. Open sourcing the technological backbone of our campaign—data dashboards, community engagement tools, policy research—allows us to tap into collective knowledge and build effective solutions together.
